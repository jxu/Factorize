Factorize
=========
Small quadratic sieve and other algorithm implementations using GMP for factoring. Not optimized.

Usage
-----
Currently you have to go into the code and adjust `n`, the number to factor. Some parameters can be fiddled with.

To do:

- Profile code
- Shanks-Tonelli algorithm
- Entirely pre-allocate memory
- Code refactoring (not factoring!)
- Improve usage
